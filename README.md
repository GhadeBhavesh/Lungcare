📱 LungCare - Lung Cancer Prediction App
LungCare is a mobile application designed to help users predict the possibility of lung cancer at an early stage.
By simply uploading a CT scan image, the app analyzes the image and compares it with a trained medical image dataset, providing an instant prediction whether the lung is cancerous or non-cancerous.

The goal of this project is to make early detection of lung cancer accessible and convenient for everyone.
